## Usage
Install the following dependencies with Maven
- ```com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-dynamodb:1.11.911```
- ```com.googlecode.json-simple:json-simple:1.1.1```

The project also requires Java 15

To start the game run ```Home.Main``` located within the ```Game``` package.

*Note at this stage of development, the server is hardcoded into the system, this can cause connection issues as the public game server is not alive 24/7. To play singleplayer change [this ip](https://github.com/nathanielCherian/SpeedySalamanders/blob/master/src/Game/Board.java#L24) variable to false before runtime. To run a development server yourself run [this](https://github.com/nathanielCherian/SpeedySalamanders/blob/master/src/Game/Multiplayer/ServerMain.java#L23) static method then change [this](https://github.com/nathanielCherian/SpeedySalamanders/blob/master/src/Game/Board.java#L25) to `127.0.0.1`*

## Goals
- We have completed the multiplayer part of the game that allows players to communicate over Java Sockets. It is a peer-to-peer model with a server that facilliatates contact.
- The multiplayer system uses a state machine that uses a system similar to the CRUD system of a database that allows all users to stay up to date and make communication efficent and minimize latency.
- Event based code was also used as we have created 3 events CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE that are all tied to the client class. This system, similar to JPanel, allows us to register the different objects easily and systematically that allows for easy expansion.

**Score 19/20**

This score is justifiable due to the amount of work that was put into the project this week. This week we collectively had as a group the highest rate of productivity through error-free code.
Everyone was able to participate and contribute to the benefit of the project. One point is lost because even though we still have much more potential which we haven't used this week. Our group
has so much more that we can accomplish and the 1 point deduction is a reminder to keep on growing

# 2D
For our project, 2D games like platformers with stages seems appropriate and we will try to create unique 2D games with stages stored in a database.
# 3D
Since the nature of 3D projects naturally makes them harder to code, we will try to sitck to a 3D running game with auto obstacles.
